## 🧭 TL;DR

**Who:** Q-commerce delivery riders (Zepto) — 2–3 km radius, one dark store, zero income safety net.

**Problem:** One flooded street eliminates their entire working zone. No insurance product covers this. 80+ disruption days a year go uncompensated.

**What Hustlr does:** Monitors 9 real-time disruption triggers. When one fires and the rider is on shift — a fixed payout hits their UPI automatically. No claim filed. No adjuster. Under 2 minutes.

**How it's built:** Flutter app · Node.js + Supabase backend · 7 AI/ML models · 7-layer fraud engine · Zone depth scoring · Regional behavioral intelligence · Full Guidewire integration (PolicyCenter + ClaimCenter + BillingCenter).

**Numbers:** ₹29–₹109/week · ₹150/day payout cap · 55–65% projected loss ratio · ₹0 infrastructure cost · 10,000-worker Chennai pilot.

> *"When there's a curfew, I can't deliver. When the app crashes, I can't deliver. When a road accident blocks my route, I can't deliver. Those days, I earn zero rupees — but my rent doesn't know that."*
> — **Karthik, 24, Zepto Q-commerce delivery rider, Chennai**

## 🔴 The Problem

India has **7.7 million** gig delivery workers. Q-commerce riders — the people delivering groceries in 10 minutes for Zepto — face the sharpest version of this problem. They operate within a strict 2–3 km radius of a single dark store. They earn ₹4,000–₹6,000 per week with no paid leave, no sick days, and no safety net. One flooded street eliminates their entire working zone. A dark store going offline wipes out a full shift. Chennai alone sees **~80 rain days per year** — on each one, a rider loses ₹400–₹600. Cyclone Michaung wiped out 3–4 days of income per worker with zero recourse.

Every existing insurance product covers accidents, hospitalization, and death — events that happen rarely. Not one covers the income disruption that happens 80+ days a year.

Hustlr fixes the right problem.

## 💡 What Hustlr Is

Hustlr is **not an insurance company.** It is an **underwriting intelligence engine** that enables licensed insurers to profitably serve gig workers — a segment traditional insurance has never been able to reach.

---

## 👤 Chosen Persona: Q-Commerce Delivery Partner

**Persona:** A Zepto delivery partner operating in Chennai — Velachery, Adyar, or Tambaram dark store zones.

Workers are registered on a **single primary platform only**, in compliance with Zepto's partner exclusivity agreement. Insurance is priced based on that platform's activity data alone — keeping the model legally clean and operationally simple.

### Why Q-Commerce?

| Factor | Q-Commerce (Zepto) | Food (Zomato/Swiggy) | E-Commerce (Amazon/Flipkart) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Delivery frequency | 15–25 orders/day | 8–15 orders/day | 3–8 orders/day |
| Hyperlocal sensitivity | Extreme (dark store zones) | High | Moderate |
| Weather vulnerability | Critical (monsoon paralysis) | High | Low–Medium |
| Worker density per zone | Very high (cluster-based) | Medium | Spread out |
| Fraud surface area | High (zone-based clustering) | Medium | Low |

Q-commerce workers operate within **tight geographic zones** anchored to dark stores, making parametric triggers more precise (zone-level, not city-level), fraud detection more nuanced (cluster behaviour becomes a signal), and income modeling more predictable (orders/hour baselines are tight).

### Persona Profile: "Karthik, 24, Zepto Partner, Adyar Dark Store Zone, Chennai"

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | Zepto (single platform — partner agreement compliant) |
| Weekly earnings | ₹4,200 (~₹600/day, ~₹60/hr over a 10-hr shift) |
| Shift window | 8 AM – 10 PM (derived from 30-day activity history) |
| Peak slots | Morning 8–11 AM · Evening 5–9 PM |
| Delivery radius | 2–3 km from Adyar dark store — zone loss = total income loss |
| Device | Android budget phone (~₹10,000) |
| Payments | UPI for all transactions |
| Savings buffer | 2–3 days of income at most |
| Financial obligations | Weekly rent + monthly family remittances |
| Annual disruption exposure | ~80 rain days · loses ₹400–₹600 per heavy rain day |

**Key disruptions Karthik faces:**

| Disruption | Frequency | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy monsoon rain | ~80 days/year | Zone completely unserviceable for 3–6 hours |
| Cyclone / extreme rain | 2–4 events/year | 3–4 days of income wiped out (Cyclone Michaung scale) |
| Platform app outage | ~2–3 times/month | Zero orders possible regardless of conditions |
| Bandh / curfew | ~8–10 days/year | Roads blocked, platform auto-pauses |
| Internet zone blackout | ~6–10 days/year | Entire operating environment goes dark |
| Accident blockspot | Weekly on GST Road / IT Corridor | 1–3 hour income gap per incident |

## ⚡ How Hustlr Works — 15-Second View

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289c1d4b-ce38-4355-81ce-223381723260" width="900" alt="Hustlr — How It Works"/>
</p>

```
1. Rain detected in Karthik's zone    →  IMD + OpenWeatherMap confirm threshold
2. Shift window check passes          →  disruption falls within Karthik's working hours
3. Zone depth score calculated        →  confirms Karthik was genuinely deep in zone, not at boundary
4. Device integrity verified          →  Play Integrity API confirms no GPS spoofing app active
5. Fraud check in < 2 seconds         →  FRS score computed across 7 independent signal layers
6. Fixed payout credited Sunday night →  ₹50/hr × verified disruption hours, capped at ₹150/day
```

No forms. No adjusters. No claim ever filed by the worker — for automated trigger events.

## ✅ What Hustlr Covers

| Covered | Not Covered |
|---------|-------------|
| Lost income during weather shutdowns (rain, cyclone, extreme heat, AQI) | Vehicle repairs or damage |
| Lost income during platform-declared outages | Medical or accident expenses |
| Lost income during civil disruptions (curfew, bandh, strike) | Personal illness or fatigue |
| Lost income during internet zone blackouts | Low-order days due to competition |

## 🏢 Insurance Partner Model

| Role | Entity |
|---|---|
| **Risk Underwriter** | Licensed insurer — ICICI Lombard / HDFC ERGO |
| **Trigger + Intelligence Engine** | Hustlr |
| **Policy Administration** | Guidewire PolicyCenter API |
| **Claims Automation** | Guidewire ClaimCenter API |
| **Premium Billing** | Guidewire BillingCenter API |
| **Distribution — Phase 1** | Direct B2C — Hustlr mobile app via WhatsApp groups + referral |
| **Distribution — Phase 2** | B2B2C — Zepto platform integration + insurer white-label |

---

## ⚙️ Guidewire Integration

### PolicyCenter
- Weekly policy creation every Monday via PolicyCenter API
- ISS score + city risk profile passed as risk attributes for premium computation
- Policy status synced back to Hustlr in real time

### ClaimCenter
- On parametric trigger: Hustlr pushes a structured, pre-validated claim payload
- Fraud Risk Score attached — ClaimCenter routes CLEAN to auto-approval, FLAGGED to human queue
- On manual claim: worker-submitted proof package routed directly to ClaimCenter review queue
- Zero-touch for weather/bandh/internet events. Structured review for manual claim types.

### BillingCenter
- Weekly premium deduction via BillingCenter direct debit scheduling
- Payout disbursement coordinated through BillingCenter's payment gateway
- Worker wallet reconciliation synced weekly

### Guidewire Marketplace
- Hustlr packaged as a Marketplace integration — any insurer on PolicyCenter/ClaimCenter can onboard Hustlr's parametric trigger engine as a configurable product extension

### B2B2C Distribution Channel (Phase 2)
After proving the model B2C, Hustlr embeds directly inside the Zepto partner app as a white-label insurance feature. Zepto pays a per-worker monthly licensing fee. The insurer underwrites the risk. Guidewire collects a technology licensing fee from the insurer.

**Why platforms pay for this:**
- Reduces worker churn during bad weather
- Differentiates Zepto in recruiting delivery partners from competitors
- Fulfills ESG mandate: "we protect our delivery partners"

---

## 📊 Parametric Logic — Core Principle

Hustlr does **not** calculate actual income loss. No investigation needed for automated triggers.

- A measurable disruption index is monitored in real time
- When it crosses a threshold AND falls within the worker's shift window → payout fires
- Payout = fixed rate per trigger type × verified disruption hours (capped at ₹150/day, ₹500/week)

```
Example:
  Trigger:          Heavy rain — IMD confirms 72mm, threshold 64.5mm crossed
  Duration:         3 hours above threshold
  Shift window:     Disruption 11 AM–2 PM within Karthik's 8 AM–10 PM  →  PASS
  Zone depth score: 0.84 — core zone confirmed  →  PASS
  Device integrity: Play Integrity API — PASS
  Fixed rate:       ₹50/hr (Heavy Rain, Standard Shield)

  Payout = ₹50 × 3 = ₹150  →  auto-disbursed to UPI Sunday night
```

**Why weekly settlement, not instant:** Claims log throughout the week. Settlement runs every Sunday at 11 PM. The fraud engine evaluates the **complete week's pattern** before any money moves. A worker who triggers 3 events in one week activates the claim velocity signal before any payout releases. Weekly settlement also perfectly matches Zepto's weekly partner payment cycle.

**Why 60–70% income replacement, not 100%:** Parametric insurance by design does not fully replace income — this is basis risk, and it is intentional. Paying ₹50/hr (67% replacement) means honest workers are protected without the product becoming a profit opportunity. Full replacement creates moral hazard. The 60–70% band is the industry standard for parametric income protection.

## 🚨 Trigger Parameters

### Automated Parametric Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold | Data Source | Hourly Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy Rain | ≥ 64.5mm / hr | IMD + OpenWeatherMap | ₹50/hr |
| Extreme Rain / Cyclone | ≥ 115.6mm / hr | IMD + OpenWeatherMap | ₹65/hr |
| Heat Wave | ≥ 43°C | IMD | ₹40/hr |
| Severe Pollution | AQI ≥ 200 | AQICN / WAQI | ₹40/hr |
| Platform App Outage | Order failure rate > 60% | Platform API + order failure rate | ₹50/hr |
| Bandh / Strike / Curfew | NLP confidence ≥ 0.6 + platform OFFLINE | NewsAPI + NLP scraper | ₹50/hr |
| Heavy Traffic Congestion | Speed ≥ 40% below historical baseline, sustained ≥ 45 min + order failure > 35% | Google Maps Traffic API + baseline model | ₹40/hr |
| Internet Zone Blackout | Connectivity < 10% in zone for ≥ 30 min | Ookla / TRAI + device signal reports | ₹50/hr |

**Payout cap:** ₹150/day · ₹500/week

### Manual Claim Triggers

| Trigger | What Worker Submits | Cross-Check Sources | SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Traffic Accident Blockspot | GPS screenshot + scene photo (EXIF-stamped) + platform earnings screenshot | Google Maps Traffic API + News API + order density | 4 hrs |
| Local Road Closure | Same as above | Municipal advisory feed + Maps | 4 hrs |
| Dark Store / Hub Shutdown | Photo of closed hub + Zepto screenshot | Platform API + NLP scraper | 4 hrs |

## ⚡ Compound Triggers — Elite Shield

Elite Shield workers receive compound trigger payouts when two disruptions occur simultaneously.

| Compound Combination | Logic | Payout % of Daily Cap |
|---|---|---|
| Rain (severe) + Platform Downtime | Both active simultaneously in zone | 100% |
| Rain (any) + Traffic Standstill | Both active in zone simultaneously | 70% |
| Extreme Heat + High AQI | Both above threshold simultaneously | 55% |
| Cyclone Watch + Rain | Advisory active + rainfall >30mm/hr | 85% |
| Dark Store Closed + Rain | Both conditions confirmed | 100% |
| Curfew + Platform Outage | Both active during shift window | 100% |

**Business logic:** When two disruptions overlap, income loss is multiplicative — not additive. Rain alone reduces deliveries by 70%. Rain plus platform downtime reduces deliveries by 100%. Elite Shield pays a compound bonus reflecting the true income impact.

**Claim-Free Cashback (Elite Shield):**
Workers on Elite Shield who complete 4 consecutive weeks without a payout receive 10% of their premiums from those 4 weeks returned as wallet credit. This solves adverse selection — rewarding workers who stay insured during calm periods builds a healthier premium pool. The cashback costs the insurer approximately ₹43 per qualifying period.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Gaming Rules

- **Minimum duration:** 45 continuous minutes above threshold before trigger activates
- **Cooling period:** Same disruption type cannot trigger again in same zone within 24 hours
- **Shift intersection:** Disruption must overlap worker's registered shift by minimum 2 hours
- **One event per week per type** for Basic and Standard Shield plans
- **Pro-rata for mid-week activation:** Worker activating on Thursday receives payout weighted by days active
- **Post-purchase coverage only:** Disruptions beginning before policy activation are never covered

### Threshold Obfuscation + Dynamic Micro-Variation

**Exact trigger thresholds are never published.** Workers see only ranges — never specific millimetre values.

The actual trigger threshold varies by ±3mm (rain) or ±0.5°C (heat) each week using a seeded random value known only to the system. Workers can never predict the exact number for the current week.

**Why this matters for Chennai specifically:** Research into Chennai delivery worker behavior reveals workers are highly financially sophisticated and actively probe incentive systems. The Rapido/cab driver pattern of gaming platform incentives is directly applicable to insurance threshold gaming. Workers in organized groups can identify precise thresholds through repeated testing and share them via WhatsApp. Threshold micro-variation makes this strategy unreliable.

## 📱 Manual Claim Filing — UX Flow

Workers filing a manual claim tap **"Report a Disruption"** on the Claims screen. This opens a 3-step guided flow designed for one-thumb operation on a budget Android device.

**Step 1 — Select Disruption Type**
```
Worker sees:
  🚧  Road Blocked / Accident
  🏪  Dark Store / Hub Closed
  🌐  Internet Outage (zone-level)
  📦  Other Delivery Blockage
```

**Step 2 — Capture Evidence (in-app, EXIF-stamped)**
```
Disruption Type          What the app asks for
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Road Blocked / Accident  1 photo (app GPS-stamps at capture)
Dark Store / Hub Closed  1 photo + Zepto screenshot (no orders)
Internet Outage          App auto-reads signal strength — no photo
Other                    1 photo + description (max 100 chars)
```

**Step 3 — Submission & Tracking**
```
Worker sees:
  "Claim submitted. We're checking 3 data sources."

Within 4 hours:
  → AUTO-APPROVED: "₹X credited to your wallet"
  → NEED MORE INFO: "Tap here to add one more photo"
  → DECLINED + EXPLANATION: "Here's why, and how to appeal"
```

## 🌐 Internet Zone Blackout — Trigger Architecture

India's gig workers are uniquely vulnerable to localized internet outages. A Zepto Q-commerce rider cannot accept orders, navigate, or scan QR codes during a connectivity blackout. One pincode blackout eliminates their entire working zone instantly.

```
Signal 1 — Ookla Real-Time Speed Map API
  Zone average download speed < 2 Mbps for 20 minutes  →  degraded flag

Signal 2 — Device crowd-reporting (passive)
  ≥ 30% of active Hustlr users in a pin-code report < 1 bar signal
  →  cluster anomaly flag

Signal 3 — TRAI outage registry
  Any registered outage for zone's ISP/tower operator  →  authoritative flag

Dual-confirmation rule:
  Signal 1 + Signal 2  →  AUTO_TRIGGER
  Signal 3 alone        →  AUTO_TRIGGER
  Signal 1 alone        →  HOLD for 20-minute reconfirmation window
```

**Fraud resistance:** Faking connectivity loss requires active data transmission to submit the claim — which is self-contradictory. This makes the internet blackout trigger one of Hustlr's most inherently fraud-resistant signals.

---

## 🚧 Accident Blockspot — Trigger Architecture

Chennai's road network has documented high-frequency accident corridors — Rajiv Gandhi Salai, GST Road, and Poonamallee High Road account for a disproportionate share of delivery-hour blockages.

```
Google Maps Traffic API:
  Route speed < 5 km/h on major corridor for ≥ 30 minutes  →  gridlock flag

Cross-checked against:
  NewsAPI / NLP scraper: "accident", "collision", "road blocked"
  in that zone within past 45 minutes  →  corroborated

Worker-assisted confirmation:
  Push: "Accident blocking detected on GST Road near you. Affected?"
  Worker: tap confirm + upload 1 photo

Hustlr cross-checks:
  →  Worker GPS on that corridor in last 30 min?
  →  Zero completed orders in that window?
  →  Is blockspot on Chennai Accident Hotspot Map?
```

**Chennai Accident Hotspot Map:**

| Tier | Corridors | Skepticism Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | GST Road, Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Poonamallee High Road | Low |
| Tier 2 | Anna Salai, Velachery Main Road, OMR | Medium |
| Tier 3 | Internal streets, zone-internal routes | High |

---

## 🚦 Heavy Traffic Congestion — Trigger Architecture

```
Step 1 — Build historical baseline per corridor per 30-min time slot:
  Google Maps Traffic API → rolling 90-day average speed

Step 2 — Detect abnormal deviation:
  Current speed < (baseline − 40%) sustained ≥ 45 minutes  →  severe flag

Step 3 — Platform order failure corroboration:
  Order failure rate in affected zone > 35%  →  confirmed

All three conditions must be met simultaneously → AUTO_TRIGGER
```

**City-specific corridor baselines (Phase 2):**

| City | High-Risk Corridor | Baseline | Trigger Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chennai | GST Road, Anna Salai | 18–22 km/h | < 11–13 km/h |
| Bengaluru | Electronic City Flyover, ORR | 15–20 km/h | < 9–12 km/h |
| Mumbai | Eastern Express Highway, WEH | 20–25 km/h | < 12–15 km/h |
| Delhi | NH48, Gurugram corridor | 22–28 km/h | < 13–17 km/h |

## 📋 Real Scenario Simulations

### Scenario A — Chennai November Rain (Automated)

```
Date:         November 12, 2025 · Location: Adyar, Chennai
IMD data:     72mm rainfall — threshold crossed for 3 hours
Shift window: 11 AM–2 PM within Karthik's 8 AM–10 PM  →  PASS
Zone depth:   Karthik's GPS shows 0.84 — core zone  →  PASS

Payout = ₹50/hr × 3 hrs = ₹150
Timeline:
  11:00 AM  →  IMD threshold crossed
  11:02 AM  →  Zone depth score: 0.84 — PASS
  11:02 AM  →  Fraud engine: FRS = 14/100 — CLEAN
  11:02 AM  →  Claim logged PENDING — Karthik notified
  Sunday    →  70% (₹105) released to wallet
  Tuesday   →  30% (₹45) released after review window
```

### Scenario B — Shadow Policy Activation

```
Karthik has no active policy this week.
Rain disruption hits Adyar zone Thursday.
System silently calculates: if Karthik had Standard Shield,
he would have received ₹150 in payout.

Accumulated over 2 weeks: ₹680 in missed payouts.

Wednesday notification:
  "You missed ₹680 in payouts this fortnight.
   Activate Standard Shield now — ₹49/week."

One tap — policy activated. Coverage starts Monday.
```

### Scenario C — Predictive Activation (Wednesday Nudge)

```
Wednesday evening — Hustlr's 72-hour forecast runs.
OpenWeather shows: 78% probability of IMD Very Heavy Rain
in Adyar zone on Friday 2 PM–6 PM.

Karthik receives push notification:
  "Heavy rain expected Friday in your zone.
   Activate ₹49 Standard Shield now to protect ₹600+ earnings."

Karthik taps → policy activated → Friday rain hits →
claim auto-triggered → ₹150 Sunday night.
The system predicted, nudged, protected, and paid —
all before the worker even thought about insurance.
```

### Scenario D — Platform App Outage (Automated via Order Failure Rate)

```
Zepto status page: "operational"
Hustlr detects: order_failure_rate = 78%  →  threshold 60% crossed

Order failure rate overrides status API — reflects ground reality.
Workers on Standard Shield receive auto-claim for outage duration.
```

### Scenario E — Internet Zone Blackout (Automated)

```
Date: February 8, 2026 — 7:00 PM · Location: Tambaram, Chennai

Signal 1 — Ookla: Tambaram avg speed 0.8 Mbps  →  degraded flag
Signal 2 — 34 of 89 active users report < 1 bar for 25 min  →  cluster flag
TRAI: BSNL tower outage logged for Tambaram 600045  →  authoritative flag

Dual confirmation → AUTO_TRIGGER
Payout = ₹50/hr × 2.5 hrs = ₹125
```

### Scenario F — Accident Blockspot (Assisted Manual)

```
GST Road near Perungudi — 8:30 PM
Google Maps: zone speed < 5 km/h for 45 min  →  gridlock
NewsAPI: "truck accident GST Road Perungudi" — confidence 0.79

Karthik taps confirm + uploads photo.
GPS match + zero orders + Tier 1 corridor confirmed.
Payout: ₹40 × 2 hrs = ₹80 — SLA: 4 hours
```

## 🛡️ Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

### The Threat

A coordinated syndicate of 500 workers organizes via Telegram. Using GPS spoofing apps, they fake their location inside a rain-alert zone while sitting at home, triggering mass false payouts.

### Why GPS Spoofing Fails Against Hustlr

Hustlr never trusts a single signal. Every payout requires **multi-stream coherence** across independent data channels that a spoofing app cannot simultaneously fake.

| Signal Layer | What It Measures | What Spoofing Looks Like |
|---|---|---|
| GPS coordinates | Claimed location | Too perfect — zero statistical jitter over 5-minute windows |
| Cell tower triangulation (OpenCelliD) | Tower the device is connected to | Home tower ID doesn't match flood zone |
| Wi-Fi fingerprint | SSIDs visible to device | Known home SSID present = flagged |
| IP geolocation (MaxMind) | ISP + approximate location | Home broadband IP ≠ claimed outdoor zone |
| Accelerometer / motion | Physical movement patterns | Stationary couch ≠ stranded outdoor worker |
| Battery charging state | Charging = plugged in at home | Charging during claimed outdoor disruption |
| Barometer / altitude | Device elevation | Ground-level flood claim from 12th floor |

### The Data — What Hustlr Analyzes

**Layer 0 — Device Integrity Check (runs before any GPS is trusted):**

Every claim is rejected before processing if the device fails integrity checks. A GPS spoofing app requires developer mode or root access — catching this at the device layer blocks the entire attack vector before a single GPS coordinate is evaluated.

```
Check 1 — Play Integrity API (Google)
  Verifies app has not been tampered with
  Confirms device is not rooted or jailbroken
  Confirms developer mode is OFF
  Returns: MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY / FAILS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY

Check 2 — Mock Location Detection
  Android exposes isMockLocation flag in location data
  If true → GPS coordinates are software-generated, not physical
  Result: claim auto-rejected, worker notified

Check 3 — Developer Mode Check
  If USB debugging enabled → adds +20 to fraud score

Rule: Any claim from a device failing Play Integrity API
      is auto-rejected before fraud scoring begins.
```

**Why this matters:** Every GPS spoofing app on Android requires mock location permissions (developer mode) or root access. Layer 0 eliminates 90%+ of spoofing attempts before any other signal is evaluated — the lowest-cost, highest-impact fraud prevention step in the entire system.

**Layer 1 — Individual Signal Checks:**

```python
SIGNAL_WEIGHTS = {
    'gps_zone_mismatch':                 25,
    'wifi_home_ssid_detected':           20,
    'battery_charging':                  15,
    'accelerometer_idle':                10,
    'platform_app_inactive':             15,
    'ip_geolocation_home_match':         20,
    'claim_latency_under_30s':           10,
    'gps_jitter_too_perfect':            15,
    'barometer_altitude_mismatch':       10,
    'device_hardware_fingerprint_match': 15,
    'app_install_timestamp_cluster':     10,
}
```

**Layer 2 — Behavioral Baseline:**
First 2 weeks build a Personal Activity Graph: home zone, normal work zones, typical hours, average motion. Claims from zones the worker has never worked in receive a behavioral penalty.

**Layer 3 — News Corroboration Score (0.25 weight in FPS):**
Before any payout, Hustlr independently queries Brave Search and NewsAPI for verified public crisis reports specific to the claimed zone and time. Absence of public corroboration is a scored fraud signal. A syndicate cannot fabricate official IMD alerts or government advisories.

**Layer 4 — Behavioral Fingerprinting:**

| Signal | What It Detects |
|---|---|
| Claim-initiation latency | Claims filed < 30s after trigger = syndicate reflex |
| Orders completed during disruption | Worker completed a delivery during claimed window → auto-reject |
| Longitudinal claim frequency | Claiming every disruption with zero post-disruption activity across weeks |
| Onboarding recency | < 2 weeks tenure + max-value Week 1 claim → elevated scrutiny |

**Layer 5 — Coordinated Ring Detection:**

| Signal | Threshold | Indication |
|---|---|---|
| Claim Surge Velocity | 50+ claims from one zone in 10 minutes | Coordinated trigger |
| Geographic Clustering (DBSCAN) | Claims in implausibly tight boundary | Ring from one Telegram group |
| Device Fingerprint Similarity | Shared hardware ID / install timestamp | Same APK distributed in ring |

**Poisson Distribution Test:** Genuine disruptions spread claim filings over 20–40 minutes. Coordinated rings fire within seconds. Uniform filing at p < 0.05 = coordinated ring confirmed.

**Layer 6 — Internet Blackout Self-Validation:**
Active device-to-server communication during a claimed blackout invalidates the claim. The trigger fires server-side from Ookla + TRAI — not from device reporting.

### The Decision Engine — Weighted Ensemble FPS

```python
FPS = weighted_ensemble(
    location_authenticity_score   × 0.25,
    delivery_zone_match_score     × 0.20,
    news_corroboration_score      × 0.25,
    behavioral_fingerprint_score  × 0.15,
    zone_anomaly_score            × 0.15
)
```

| Tier | FPS Range | Action |
|---|---|---|
| GREEN | 0.0 – 0.30 | Auto-approve — payout within 2 minutes |
| YELLOW | 0.31 – 0.60 | Soft hold — "verifying, reply within 2 hours" |
| RED | 0.61 – 1.00 | Human review — provisional ₹100–300 credit released immediately |

### Zone Context Override During Declared Emergencies

When IMD or NDMA issues an official disaster advisory, all FPS thresholds in that zone are elevated by 15 points for the advisory duration. Genuine stranded workers in cyclone zones are not subjected to fraud scrutiny during the worst events.

### Protecting Honest Workers — Five Principles

**Principle 1:** Soft holds, not hard rejections. RED always receives provisional credit immediately.

**Principle 2:** Zone context override during officially declared emergencies.

**Principle 3:** Worker Trust Score (backend only) — 8+ weeks clean history reduces effective FPS by up to 15 points.

**Principle 4:** Transparent auto-explanation on every rejection naming which signals triggered the flag, plus one-tap appeal within 4 hours.

**Principle 5:** No permanent action without confirmed multi-signal fraud across multiple events.

### Network Drop Signal Recognition — Honest Worker Protection Flow

When a worker's GPS signal is lost during a disruption event, Hustlr does not automatically reject their claim. It runs a specific verification flow to distinguish a genuine stranded worker from a fraudster at home.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ND1[GPS Signal Lost During Disruption] --> ND2{Wi-Fi SSID Check}
    ND2 -- Home SSID detected --> ND3[Worker at home\nClaim rejected]
    ND2 -- Unknown SSID or no Wi-Fi --> ND4{Cell Tower Check}
    ND4 -- Tower in disruption zone --> ND5[Worker physically in zone\nClaim approved with delay note]
    ND4 -- Tower outside zone --> ND6{Platform Activity Check}
    ND6 -- Zero orders in window --> ND7[Signal ambiguous\nFlag for soft review\nDo NOT auto-reject]
    ND6 -- Orders found --> ND8[Worker was active\nClaim rejected]
    ND5 --> ND9[Payout Released\nWorker notified: verification complete]
    ND7 --> ND10[30-min grace window\nRe-check all signals\nWorker notified: verifying automatically]
```

**The 30-minute grace window:** GPS loss alone never causes auto-rejection. The system always checks two independent alternative signals before making any determination. A worker stranded in a flood zone with no connectivity is exactly the worker Hustlr exists to protect.

---

## 📍 Zone Depth Scoring — Anti-Boundary Gaming

**The problem with binary zone membership:** Workers can game a hard boundary by standing 50 metres inside it during a disruption. A financially sophisticated Chennai worker will learn where the boundary is and exploit it.

**Hustlr's solution — Continuous Zone Depth Score:**

```
Zone divided into 3 concentric rings around dark store:

  Outer ring    (0–500m inside boundary)    depth score: 0.00–0.20
  Middle ring   (500m–2km from boundary)    depth score: 0.21–0.60
  Core zone     (2km+ from any boundary)    depth score: 0.61–1.00

Worker's depth score = mean of all GPS pings during shift

Payout multiplier:
  Score 0.00–0.20  →  0.0   (no payout — boundary gaming detected)
  Score 0.21–0.40  →  0.30  (30% of calculated payout)
  Score 0.41–0.60  →  0.60  (60%)
  Score 0.61–0.80  →  0.85  (85%)
  Score 0.81–1.00  →  1.00  (full payout)

Additional rule: worker must have at least one GPS ping
in the core zone during the 4 hours before disruption trigger fired.
```

A worker who runs to the zone edge the moment rain starts has a depth score near zero — payout multiplier of 0.0. A worker who spent their entire shift delivering deep inside the zone has a depth score of 0.84 — full payout. There is no single coordinate to stand on.

## 🤖 AI/ML Architecture

### Model 1 — Income Stability Score (ISS)

**Purpose:** Risk score 0–100 per worker, used to recommend the most appropriate weekly plan and calibrate premium pricing.

**Phase 1 — Rule Engine:**

```python
def calculate_iss(zone_flood_risk, avg_daily_income,
                  disruption_freq_12mo, claims_history_penalty):
    score = 100
    score -= zone_flood_risk * 20
    score -= min(disruption_freq_12mo, 15)
    score += min(avg_daily_income / 200, 10)
    score -= claims_history_penalty
    return max(0, min(100, score))
```

**Phase 2:** XGBoost upgrade when real worker data available.

**Real datasets used:**
- IMD District Rainfall 2015–2024 — imdpune.gov.in
- PLFS Gig Worker Earnings Survey 2023 — mospi.gov.in
- data.gov.in Pincode-Zone Directory

### Model 2 — ISS-Based Onboarding Tier Recommendation

```
ISS 0–29   →  Recommend Elite Shield (₹109/wk)
ISS 30–49  →  Recommend Full Shield (₹79/wk)
ISS 50–69  →  Recommend Standard Shield (₹49/wk)
ISS 70–100 →  Recommend Basic Shield (₹29/wk)

Add-on recommendations:
  Zone bandh frequency > 4/year   →  Curfew & Strike add-on
  Platform outage rate > 2/month  →  App Downtime add-on
  Coastal cyclone belt zone        →  Cyclone add-on
```

### Model 3 — Fraud Detection Engine (FRS)

Seven-layer stacked scoring using the weighted ensemble FPS architecture. Runs in < 2 seconds. Isolation Forest feature vector:

```python
def build_claim_vector(claim_event):
    return [
        claim_event.zone_grid_id,
        claim_event.unix_timestamp % 86400,
        get_simultaneous_claims_in_zone(claim_event.zone_grid_id,
                                        claim_event.timestamp,
                                        window_minutes=15),
        claim_event.device_subnet_hash,
        claim_event.device_hardware_id_hash,
        claim_event.app_install_timestamp,
        claim_event.os_version_hash,
        days_since_onboarding(claim_event.worker_id),
        referral_chain_depth(claim_event.worker_id)
    ]
```

### Model 4 — NLP Disruption Scraper

**Phase 1:** spaCy keyword scoring. Dual confirmation required.

**Phase 2:** LLM preprocessing for unstructured government advisories. The LLM touches preprocessing only — every YES/NO payout decision is deterministic and auditable.

```
INPUT:  "IMD issues red alert for Chennai district. Extremely heavy
         rainfall expected between 6 PM and midnight tonight."

OUTPUT: { "trigger": "extreme_rain", "zone": "Chennai",
          "confidence": 0.95, "window_start": "18:00",
          "window_end": "24:00", "date": "2026-03-20" }
```

### Model 5 — Internet Connectivity Anomaly Detector

```python
BLACKOUT_THRESHOLD = {
    'ookla_avg_speed_mbps':       2.0,
    'device_cluster_pct_weak':    0.30,
    'sustained_minutes':          20,
    'trai_registry_match':        True
}
```

### Model 6 — Accident Blockspot Classifier

```python
def classify_blockspot(zone, traffic_signal, news_signal, time_of_day):
    congestion_prob = congestion_baseline_model.predict(zone, time_of_day)
    if congestion_prob > 0.80:
        return "NORMAL_CONGESTION"
    if news_signal['confidence'] >= 0.65 and traffic_signal['duration_min'] >= 30:
        return "ACCIDENT_BLOCKSPOT"
    return "INCONCLUSIVE"
```

Sourced from NCRB Road Accident Statistics 2023 and Chennai Traffic Police data.

### Model 7 — Facebook Prophet Forecasting (Phase 3)

Forecasts 4-week disruption frequency per zone. Feeds insurer admin dashboard with capital reservation estimates. Trained on IMD District Rainfall 2015–2024 + Chennai bandh history from NLP archive.

## 🌏 Regional Behavioral Intelligence Layer

### The Chennai Insight

Research into Chennai delivery worker behavior — through Reddit (r/Chennai, r/india), delivery partner forums, Twitter/X, and YouTube delivery partner vlogs — reveals a consistent pattern: Chennai gig workers are financially sophisticated and actively probe platform incentive systems. The Rapido/cab driver behavior of understanding surge mechanics and finding system edges is directly applicable to parametric insurance.

**What the research identified:**

1. Workers share threshold information in WhatsApp groups within hours of discovery
2. Delivery partner communities in Chennai are highly organized
3. Financial incentive awareness is high — workers track per-order rates, surge timing, and bonus structures precisely
4. Collective action is common — Chennai workers have organized successful platform negotiations previously

### Regional Behavior Risk Index

| City | Behavioral Risk Index | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| Chennai | 0.65 | High financial literacy, organized communities, incentive-aware |
| Bengaluru | 0.55 | Tech-adjacent workforce, individual optimization focus |
| Mumbai | 0.50 | Volume-focused, less community coordination |
| Delhi | 0.45 | Diverse worker base, lower coordination density |
| Tier 2 cities | 0.30 | Lower financial literacy, less organized |

**How this index is used:**
- Adjusts fraud signal weights regionally
- Informs the threshold micro-variation range
- Calibrates zone depth scoring multiplier curve
- NOT used to deny individual claims — portfolio-level actuarial input only

**The ethical boundary:** Regional behavioral intelligence adjusts system-level thresholds and fraud weights. It never denies an individual worker's claim based on their city alone.

---

## 🚀 Innovation Differentiators

### 1. Shadow Policy — Uninsured Worker Conversion

Workers who have not purchased insurance are tracked in a **shadow policy mode**. After 2 weeks, the app displays:
> *"You would have received ₹680 in payouts this fortnight if you were insured. Rain disruption Oct 12 → ₹450. Platform downtime Oct 08 → ₹230."*

Acquisition cost for a worker who converts via shadow policy = ₹0.

### 2. Predictive Insurance Activation

Every Wednesday evening, Hustlr runs a 72-hour disruption forecast. If probability exceeds 60%, workers receive:
> *"Heavy rain expected Friday 2–6 PM in your Adyar zone. Activate Standard Shield now to protect up to ₹600 of Friday earnings."*

Workers activate before the disruption — not after. A 65% loss ratio on a ₹49 premium is ₹17 profit per worker per week.

### 3. Play Integrity API as Layer 0

Catching GPS spoofing at the device level before any GPS data is processed. Every spoofing app requires developer mode or root — Hustlr blocks this at the entry point, eliminating 90%+ of spoofing attempts before fraud scoring begins.

### 4. Zone Depth Scoring

Replaces binary zone membership with continuous presence scoring. No other team will implement this.

### 5. Regional Behavioral Intelligence

Chennai-specific fraud calibration based on gig worker community research. The system gets harder to game over time as the NLP scanner detects new exploitation patterns weekly.

### 6. Internet Blackout as First-Class Trigger

For Q-commerce workers who cannot operate without connectivity, an internet blackout is as income-destroying as rain. No parametric insurance product in India currently covers this.

### 7. Insurer Profitability Simulator

> *"If a Cyclone Michaung-level event hits Chennai today, what is total payout exposure across all active policies?"*

Exactly the kind of enterprise risk tool Guidewire builds for large insurers — packaged inside Hustlr.

## 💰 Weekly Premium Tiers

| Plan | Weekly Premium | Covers | Expected Weekly Payout | Target Loss Ratio | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Basic Shield** | ₹29/wk | Rain + extreme heat | ~₹19 | 0.65 | Low-risk zones, new workers |
| **Standard Shield** ⭐ | ₹49/wk | Rain, heat, pollution, app downtime | ~₹32 | 0.65 | Most city delivery workers |
| **Full Shield** | ₹79/wk | All types incl. bandh + internet blackout | ~₹53 | 0.67 | Flood-zone workers |
| **Elite Shield** 🔥 | ₹109/wk | All types + compound triggers + 10% cashback | ~₹60 | 0.55 | High-traffic zone workers |

### Premium Bounds — Actuarial Guardrails

Regardless of AI risk score output, weekly premiums are hard-capped:

| Bound | Multiplier | Example (Standard Shield ₹49 base) |
|---|---|---|
| Maximum | 2.0× base tier rate | ₹98/week |
| Minimum | 0.7× base tier rate | ₹34/week |

**Why bounds exist:** Without a ceiling, a Velachery worker during a cyclone forecast week could receive an unbounded premium — making the product unaffordable exactly when they need it most. The 2× ceiling ensures accessibility during high-risk periods. The 0.7× floor ensures the insurer never writes coverage below the actuarial minimum needed to sustain the pool.

### Income Add-Ons

| Add-On | Weekly Cost | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Curfew & Strike | +₹15/wk | Bandh, curfew, Section 144 |
| Election Day | +₹20/wk | Polling day restricted movement |
| App Downtime | +₹12/wk | Platform outage via order failure rate |
| Cyclone | +₹25/wk | Extreme rain + cyclone alerts |
| Internet Blackout *(Phase 2)* | +₹18/wk | Zone-level connectivity outage |
| Accident Blockspot *(Phase 2)* | +₹15/wk | Road blocked on hotspot corridors |
| Heavy Traffic Congestion *(Phase 2)* | +₹15/wk | Speed ≥ 40% below baseline for ≥ 45 min |

## 🏙️ City Risk Profiles

Each city gets a composite risk score from 8 local data points:

| Data Point | Source |
|---|---|
| 10-year IMD rainfall history | imdpune.gov.in |
| NDMA flood zone maps | ndma.gov.in |
| Bandh/strike frequency (NLP archive) | Hustlr NLP scraper |
| Platform order density | Platform API |
| Average disruption hours per event | IMD + historical |
| Internet outage frequency | TRAI + Ookla |
| Accident blockspot density | NCRB + Traffic Police |
| Peak traffic congestion frequency | Google Maps historical |

- **Chennai:** High flood + moderate bandh + high accident density (GST Road / IT Corridor) + high behavioral gaming risk
- **Kolkata:** Highest bandh score in India + moderate flood
- **Bengaluru:** Low bandh + high internet outage + high accident density (Electronic City flyover)
- **Mumbai:** Extreme monsoon + low bandh + high accident density (Eastern/Western Expressways)

## 🏗️ Platform Decision — Mobile App (Flutter)

Delivery workers do not use laptops. Every interaction happens on a ₹10,000 Android phone at a red light. Designed for one-thumb operation and 3-second tasks.

The anti-spoofing engine requires direct native access to: cell tower IDs, Wi-Fi SSID fingerprints, GPS jitter readings, accelerometer, battery state, barometric pressure, signal strength, and Play Integrity API. PWAs cannot reliably access all of these on Android. Flutter provides full native sensor access plus a single codebase for both Android (worker app) and web (insurer admin dashboard).

Background GPS tracking via `flutter_background_geolocation` runs continuously during shifts — even when the phone screen is off — providing the continuous location data that zone depth scoring requires.

**Phase 1 — B2C Direct (Months 0–12):**
```
Target:      10,000 Zepto workers in Chennai
Acquisition: WhatsApp delivery partner groups +
             referral program (₹50 wallet credit per referral)
Revenue:     ₹49 avg weekly premium × 10,000 workers
             = ₹4.9 lakhs/week
Goal:        Prove loss ratio stays below 65%
             Prove fraud rate stays below 5%
             Accumulate 12 months of real claims data
```

**Phase 2 — B2B2C Platform Sales (Months 12+):**
```
Pitch to Zepto:
  "10,000 of your delivery partners already use this.
   Loss ratio: 61%. Fraud rate: 3.2%.
   License it and offer it natively inside your app."

Pitch to ICICI Lombard / HDFC ERGO:
  "12 months of parametric claims data for Q-commerce
   workers in Chennai. Proven insurable at 61% loss ratio.
   License our engine."
```

### Premium Structure

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Premium frequency | Weekly deduction | Matches gig worker pay cycle |

| Repricing cycle | Every 6 months | Adjusts for seasonal risk shifts |
| Payout type | Fixed amounts per trigger type | Parametric simplicity |

### Pool Protection Architecture

|---|---|---|
| Weekly payout cap | 80% of available pool | 20% always liquid |
| Daily worker cap | ₹150/day | Per-worker exposure limit |
| Weekly worker cap | ₹500/week | Cyclone week protection |
| Reserve fund | 25% of all premiums | Claims overflow buffer |
| Geographic concentration | Hard 25% cap per city | Correlated loss prevention |
| Reinsurance trigger | Losses exceeding 4× weekly pool | Catastrophic transfer |
